# Imber
Imber recursively scans files and directories in a given path. It searches for patterns in files that match a complex regular expression defined in the `patt` variable. The script prompts the user to enter a directory path, performs the scan, and outputs the matching patterns to a file named "cred.txt."

### Installation & Usage 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/by1nn1t/Imber.git

chmod +x imber.sh

./imber.sh
```

### Example Content of Scanned Files:

```bash
file1.txt:

Username: john_doe
Password: StrongPass123!
Email: john@example.com

file2.txt:

Temporary login:
Username: admin
Password: Admin!2024

Security code: 8jrf*2028AB

file3.txt:

Invalid passwords:
abcd1234
passWord

Generated cred.txt Output:

StrongPass123!
Admin!2024
8jrf*2028AB
```
In this example, only the lines that match the pattern (having at least one uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, special character, and 8 or more characters) are included in cred.txt.
